# TurtleAlphabets
This repository is a collection of python functions that represent a logical way to draw letters with the intention of adding those letters to other letters and making sentences

# Contribute
Would you like to contribute? This project is not finished yet. The only letters available are the letters in "HAPPY NEW YEAR". You can become a collaborator and help to complete the code by adding support for more letters. I appreciate all collaborations, bug findings, and reviews.
