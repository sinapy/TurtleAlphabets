# TurtleAlphabets
This repository is a collection of python functions that represent a logical way to draw letters with the intention of adding those letters to other letters and making sentences

# How to use
Go to main.py, install all required packages. Go all the way down, and replace what is inside draw_word(   ) with what you want.

# TODO
- [ ] multi-line printing 


# Contribute
Would you like to contribute? This project is not finished yet. The only letters available are the letters checked in the TODO list. You can become a collaborator and help to complete the code by adding support for more letters. I appreciate all collaborations, bug findings, and reviews.
